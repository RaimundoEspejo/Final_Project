Final project for 2025 Principles and Techniques of Reproducible Science

Four different viral isolates underwent seven serial passages in two distinct substrates: chicken embryonated eggs or Vero cells. After each passage, viral load was determined by quantifying the relative amount of viral RNA per sample. Whole genome sequencing was conducted using the Illumina platform. To identify specific genomic positions exhibiting evolutionary changes during passaging, allele frequencies were analyzed using a trend test.
